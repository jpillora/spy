# Spy

Spy is a simple, general purpose, cross platform, file system watcher written in Go (Golang). Spy takes a `directory` and a `program` and runs `program` whenever a file in `directory` changes.

### Install

**Binaries**

See [Releases](https://github.com/jpillora/spy/releases)

**Source**

```
go get -v github.com/jpillora/spy
```

### Quick start

Auto-restart your Go server

``` sh
$ spy go run main.go
spy 2015/03/02 01:40:40.248290 Watching .
2015/03/02 01:40:40 listening on 8080...
# ... change a file ...
spy 2015/03/02 01:40:43.996842 Restarting...
2015/03/02 01:40:44 listening on 8080...
```

### Usage

```
$ spy --help

	Usage: spy [options] program ...args

	program (along with its args) is initially run and then restarted with every file
	change. program will always be run from the current working directory.

	Options:

	--dir DIR, Watches for changes to all files in DIR (defaults to the current
	directory). After each change, program will be restarted.

	--inc INCLUDE - Describes a path to files to watch. Use ** to wildcard directories
	and use * to wildcard file names. This path will be made relative to DIR. For example,
	you could watch all Go source files with "--inc **/*.go" or all	JavaScript source
	files in ./lib/ with "--inc lib/**/*.js".

	--exc EXCLUDE - Describes a path to files not to watch. Inverse of INCLUDE. For
	example, you could exclude your static front-end directory with "--exc static".

	--delay DELAY, Restarts are throttled by DELAY (defaults to '0.5s'). For example,
	a "save all open files" action might trigger multiple file changes, though only
	a single restart would occur since these changes would all fall inside the DELAY
	period.

  --match MATCH - Describes a pattern for path to files to watch. For example
	"--match '(go|txt|po)$'".

	--color -c, Color of log text. Can choose between: c,m,y,k,r,g,b,w.

	--verbose -v, Enable verbose logging

	--quiet -q, Disable all logging

	--version, Display version (` + VERSION + `)
